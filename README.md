# 50-Mon

This is a coursework project from Harvard University`s CS50G.

# Implemented Features:

Auto-Trigger on Level Up: Stat menu appears automatically after a victorious battle when a Pokemon levels up.

Integrated Level-Up Flow: Menu seamlessly follows the standard "Level Up" message.

Detailed Stat Breakdown: Displays individual stat changes:
- Base Stat: Starting value before level up.
- Level Up Bonus: Increase due to this level up.
- New Total: Final stat value after level up.

Non-Intrusive Design: No cursor, keeps focus on stat changes with minimal UI elements.

State-Based Management: Implemented as a separate state within the game's state management system.
